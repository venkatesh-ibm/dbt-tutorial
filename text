Enabling clear visibility, control, and risk awareness of S3 buckets and their permissions.

At CCR, as we onboard more tenants to our AWS accounts, managing and understanding access to hundreds of S3 buckets has become increasingly critical for both security and operational efficiency.

The COPE team needs a centralized, human-friendly view of bucket permissions, associated risks, and usage patterns to support governance and operational excellence.

Reviewing and maintaining cross-account access granted across multiple tenants is essential to ensure relevance and minimize unnecessary exposure.

Automating insights into bucket configurations saves time, reduces manual errors, and enhances the tenant experience by providing actionable, up-to-date information.

Empowering platform teams and tenants with key S3 metrics — such as bucket size, object count, lifecycle policies, versioning status, encryption configuration, storage class distribution, and replication status — helps drive better cost control, risk mitigation, and informed decision-making.
